- [Introduction to Rene Girard and Mimetic Desire lecture.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Qu6vBebwwg)
    - Humans mimic each other. In particular, we tend to mimic people that we want to be like. I had always viewed this from the perspective that we can only mimic people that we know well. But in reality, we can also mimic celebrities, founders, sports people etc. Knowing this, is it not important to try to mimic the *right* people rather than trying to mimic nobody at all if we assume this is innate to human nature?
- [All-In holiday special](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caPPzcgGvtw). Funny.
- [Dominic Cummings on Modern Wisdom.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-HhIfpBdoQ)
    - Noted that campaigns were Raegan and Clinton - I’d like to study them to find out what exactly makes them great.
    - Also, interesting narrative about Vote Leave team which entered government with plans about e.g. skilled immigration but then ramped up unskilled immigration instead. Vote Leave team leaves, Rwanda policy etc.
- [All-In with Sheryl Sandberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxbtNsenZJY). This was mostly about the atrocities done by Hamas on women but also about remembering her husband. Really difficult to listen episode.
- [All-in from start of December on xAI, with Gavin Baker and Joe Lonsdale as guests.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2xfW3hgxb4&list=PLn5MTSAqaf8peDZQ57QkJBzewJU1aUokl&index=4)
    - Elon musk holds and the parallerisation of 100,000 gpus that nobody thought possible. If scaling laws are true, then X will be biggest winner. Then you add data from X on top of this, which only Elon has access to, xAI will be an even bigger winner because it’s data the models have not seen until now.
    - China’s large jump in energy production and comparison that we are able to increase our energy but China is able to 8x their energy and we should try to match that.
    - In Singapore, air conditioning increased the productivity of the country.
- [All-in from start of December](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hY_glSDyGUU&list=PLn5MTSAqaf8peDZQ57QkJBzewJU1aUokl&index=2)
    - on new bill, opportunities with new government, how their mentality is much more like a startup.
    - Younger government than usual - completely changed over compared to previous time, an actual MAGA.
    - Interesting point about openai they want to make it for-profit, valuation of 160billion? Zuck is on Elon’s side which is interesting saying they should not allow transition.
    - World spending 5 trillion on software, spending will be smaller because of AI, although maybe not because of other opportunities.
- [All-in predictions.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxNUAwBWX4I&list=PLn5MTSAqaf8peDZQ57QkJBzewJU1aUokl&index=1)
    - Interesting points here were being optimistic about austerity. With the new US government, lots of cuts and deregulation, will mean that austerity will be trending. Not spending more than you earn.
    - Interesting decoupling has happened between crypto and stable coins where their demand is not correlated tot he price of bitcoin anymore.
    - Biggest business winners being Google and Tesla.
    - Biggest business losers being the trillion dollar companies because there is too much concentration of capital there already.
    - Contrarian belief being the rise of socialism because of cuts. Usually when there are cuts like this there are always people who get left behind.
- [Deyan Asparouhov and Nadia Asparouhova](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/upstream-with-erik-torenberg/id1678893467?i=1000681939350)
    - Most interesting point was that people treat relationships not as something which should be worked upon but rather something that they quit. Instead more people should consider them as something they need to work through and persevere through when things are not going well.
