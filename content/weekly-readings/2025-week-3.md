- [Palantir is overvalued](https://equitybrian.substack.com/p/is-palantir-a-bubble) - market cap is similar to establishments like LMT, but they have a fraction of the revenues. EP ratio is 150, compared to NVIDIA 54.
- [TikTok recommendation engine paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07663) *To mitigate the effect of Concept Drift, serving models need to be updated from new user feedback as close to real-time as possible to reflect the latest interest of a user.*
    - also overflowed into a hole and went onto looking for more [TikTok recommendation engine sources](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8491456) and a comment explaining the [hashing contribution they made](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8491456).

    - Trumpt wants Greenland for after the ice melts. Insurance market capped at 3 million per house (regulation) but also the premium cannot be adjusted because of changing predictions too quickly - mis-priced risk,
    - Zuck removing filtered content - more to satisfy musk or what he actually believes
- [The rest is politics](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-rest-is-politics-us/id1743030473?i=1000683351873) US
    - They were sensible about Trump’s points on Greenland
    - Trump is the least “MAGA” person
- AFD on Daly Mail and Brussels Sprouts - Not very interesting but good backgrounds on what AFD is spiked by what I read about Musk being involved with them.
- [Marc Andreesen on Rick Rubin](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/tetragrammaton-with-rick-rubin/id1671669052?i=1000640405874)
    - Elon had a memes dealer
    - Cancel culture is like totaliarism - opportunities get taken away, you cant work, you’re driven underground,
    - He talks about preference falsification e.g. people changing their minds immediately after election results.
    - Groups of people getting together and speaking together is a core speed up for change (now we have chats, not gatherings), this has a much lower barrier for entry, does that mean more change?
    - Good quote was: The thing that generates laughter is true, the thing that generates applause is the thing that people want to like.
    - Top Gun Maverick is apparently a reversal of woke with aggressive ambitious people trying to do great things - it was a success, he said most Hollywood things have tanked they have like 50/50 quotas on everything.

    - TV ratings are so down, its just dead - the medium for information has changed completely.
    - SF is cultural centre of universe - always in and always out, UK 2 years after that
    - Pew research - religious groups opinions of other religious groups (the mormons love everyone)
    - You can be ruled by tyranny of the one, tyranny of the many and tyranny of the few - America is ruled by tyranny of the few - an oligarchy - e.g. billionaires pact. First contrarian is actually Larry Page again this, by giving money to Elon Musk not charity
    - All Philantropy is emotional
    - People in similar circles, even in founder circles, are expected to agree with each other, there is no seeking of truth.

    - Children start with two learning “programs” - conformity bias, copying whatever everyone else is doing and prestige bias, copying whatever they think
    - virtual world is asynchronous, real world is synchronous

    - rates of anxiety and repression are up (self reported harm and suicide rates)
