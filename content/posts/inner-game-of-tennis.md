I am fascinated by sports-people’s mental performance. I play tennis and often struggle mentally - I often feel I practise better but play bad in matches, frequently the harder I try, the worse my shots become. 

Gallwey explains how we can think of our self as having two parts; Self 1 is the judgemental part which criticises or praises. Self 2 is the unconscious mind and the nervous system. When something goes wrong, Self 1 often rushes to make a judgement and quickly make a correction, trying too hard to make things happen. Instead, he urges us to try and observe with interest when something goes wrong, not judge it. Then, instead of forcefully correcting it, we should picture the desired outcome and trust Self 2 to “let it happen”. 

The book tries to move away from the conventional way of learning: 

criticise or praise → give give instructions of how to do it right → force yourself to do it right

Towards an inner way of learning:

non-judgemental observation → imagine desired outcome → “let it happen” intuitively 

Key Takeaways for me:
- Technical instructions can be translated to awareness instructions. Observe mistakes instead of forcing new instructions.
- Focusing attention can improve tennis but playing tennis can also help you learn to focus your attention. Do this curiously by being interested in something specific (e.g. seams of ball).
- Lapses in concentration happen when we dwell on what happened and what will happen. We are not in the now - instead can use breathing to get anchored again.
- Competition is only good for as long as there is challenge involved. Gallwey uses surfing as an example - surfers wait for the biggest wave they can tackle. In tennis, the challenge comes from a better opponent - we should embrace better play from opponent.
- If aim is to be challenged, worry should not be about winning, instead it should be about trying to win - this is what we can control. When we don’t even try, we always have an alibi - “I did not succeed but it does not count because I did not really try” is a go-to saying for some people (I have also been an offender).
- Maximum effort does not mean the over-exertion of Self 1, but maximum determination, concentration and trusting your body to let it happen.
