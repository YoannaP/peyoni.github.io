I was recently thinking about where I learnt to work hard. I think it was during my last year of school. Our physics teacher (who was also head of science at the school) gave the option to people to go and study at the physics department, after official school hours. 

This allowed close collaboration between people taking science and maths, we learnt to work together on problems, and train for exams. We could work for deeper and longer periods of time, since this was the last school building to close (later than the school library). 

It was also private - few people chose to go there. 

I think I owe a lot of my work ethic to those long hours in the physics department, and therefore to i) the teacher who allowed this opportunity and ii) to the students who took it.
