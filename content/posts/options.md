*This is based off a talk I did to MSc Computing students at Imperial as part of Meet Your Alumni Series.* 

I haven’t worked for a significant amount of time, but I have tried to work hard and for better or for worse tried a range of things. Talking about them can hopefully help people make slightly more informed decisions. 

**Option 1: Large Corporation** 

I started working right after university in a large corporation - Morgan Stanley. I was doing a mixture of data wrangling, analytics and work on dashboards for clients. Large comps are great if you want to have a very stable career. Of course, you have access to an amazing network of people and it’s super easy to tap into the network because they are on the company’s mailing list. It gives you a big name CV boost. But the systems are very old, if you want to get anything through quickly, you will not be able to. 

That makes sense. These companies are made to resist small disruptive agents and that’s why they survive. So as an individual, it’s difficult to make a difference, at least right off the bat. 

**Option 2: Quant Fund** 

What I really wanted to do was be a quant trader - RenTech style. I joined a small systematic hedge fund, where I learnt a lot about how to think about data and modelling markets. This was a very head-down environment, where you do pretty much one thing and one thing only - research to find alpha. 

A lot of people try to solve cool problems for the sake of solving cool problems. It’s not easy to say that you have solved a valuable problem, I think unless you make money it can be quite subjective. In quant trading, it’s objective. The problem statement is very well-defined and super ambitious. Also, even if you so solve the problem, you have to keep innovating because there will be someone out there who tries to out-innovate you. So it continues to push you to come up with better and better ideas. 

**Option 3: Go Solo**

As I was working at the fund, I was also reading a lot of entrepreneurial books and starting to feel very entrepreneurial too - I wanted to work on my own stuff. I looked for ownership. That’s when I got into sports trading. Here, you have to build the whole quant trading system from scratch - finally the ownership I was looking for (a LOT of it). You need to think about things that you’ve never thought about before, like reliability of systems and everything infrastructure and ops related. Then there is the whole side of how do you get good data that you can trust? Working alone and for yourself is a whole different beast to working for someone else. 

The hardest thing is keeping motivation when things go wrong and continuing to come up with ideas. You need to be really hot-headed and deeply believe that what you’re working on is possible. Sports trading got a little easier once we got to know people who were very successful - you learn it’s possible to do well.  

There are so many people who attempt to go solo in different contexts and from a range of backgrounds, take Ed Thorpe (academic turned gambler, turned trader), Jobs and Wozniak (changing the world with an invention) and the Whatsapp founders (applying to Facebook for jobs, being rejected and then being acquired). 

The point being here, that if going solo works out, it’s amazing. But, you never have anyone telling you what to work on, you need to look for the problem. How do you look for something when you don’t know what you’re looking for? That’s the hard part. 

**Option 4: Early Stage Startup**

I like working with people. Joining a startup can give you incredible mentorship and experience if you get it right. There isn’t much point to say why it makes sense to join an early stage startup since I’ve already written about it. 

I know I sound like someone who is never happy with the current state, having jumped around so much. Someone with a *grass is always greener on the other side* mentality. That is true, but I think it might be ok if you are always learning.
