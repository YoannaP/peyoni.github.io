I have been trying to build a profitable sports trading strategy on Betfair for a little more than a year. This was initially a weekend and after work hobby. I left my job 3 months ago and focused full time on trying to build something which is profitable. For the past 2-3 months, I can now say that we are building a profitable strategy (not trying to anymore). 

Being a quant is what my official title was before leaving my job. In brief, quants build algorithms which automatically trade on an exchange. We carry out analysis using some code and maths to find ‘edge’. We try to take an advantageous position, for example buy or sell, such that we generate money in the long term. You can probably have a quant in any field, really - quants of insurance are actuaries for example. The sports markets are a good application of quant skills. 

The UK has an amazing culture of sports betting. Betfair facilitates the buying and selling of bets on a market place. You can either BACK (support a selection) or LAY (bet against a selection). In sum, it is exactly like the financial markets, but with less competition and liquidity in certain sports. And therefore, it is the perfect opportunity for a playground of solo-trading. 

In retrospect, the hardest thing is to retain a keep going mindset when nothing is working. One things which has been helpful here was connecting with successful people in the field - they can show you what is possible, despite having failed multiple times. People could say that this is due to the usual survivorship bias, which is an explanation I dislike. Successful people could be so because of survivorship bias, but many times they have had to fight for these opportunities - It is luck but not coincidence! 

In sports trading, there are victims and there are victors. I don’t mean that there are people who lose, and people who gain. The markets are meritocratic and if you lose and complain you will always be a victim - in life, and in sports trading. The victim part is the complaint part - you can lose and be a victor. I partly stole this idea from a very old obscure blog post on BetAngel, which I am not able to find, sadly. 

I was not particularly restricted in terms of what I could and could not do in my previous job, but if I wanted to push harder at a certain project, there was no effect -  I was never moving the company forward in any particular way. Instead here, we move fast - we decide what we want and implement. Slowness makes me slightly crazy. 

It pays better to be useful instead of sophisticated. Credits for this realisation should probably go to robotjames’ articles. This is something which, even after working for 3 years in the markets, I didn’t have a grasp on. This mental model for trading was revolutionary for me, but again, in life - echoing the recent book by Arnold Schwarzenegger, it might be better, perhaps I shall write about this in more detail later. 

The betting has been a productive achievement, bringing purpose and happiness - it makes me excited. I have mostly talked about behavioural things because learning technical skills from this are obvious. Behavioural things are more subtle, difficult to put into words with non-obvious benefits until you stop, and think.
