Sports trading was a weekend and after-work activity for just over a year. For the past 2-3 months, after leaving my job and focusing more on this, there have finally been signs of profitability.


A year of working on something, without hard accomplishements (even part time) is a long time to keep motivated - this was probably the most difficult thing. It is easy to work hard when you have an externally imposed task, like at a job, school or university. Self-imposed tasks are easy to circumvent with excuses. So what helps pushing hard? I think it is useful to have an intolerant attitude towards non-accomplishement. It is the uncomfortable inside itch caused from a fear of failing mediocrely that really helps in these situations. 

What I think also helps is connecting and talking with other people (in sports trading it could be in obscure forums). You see that people are successful and what is possible to accomplish. People could say that this is due to survivorship bias, which is an explanation I dislike because it gives not enough credit to grit. It could be survivorship bias, but many times they have had to overcome the adversity for the next opportunities: [it is luck but not an accident!](https://chrissacca.com)

In sports trading (and in life), there are victims and there are victors. I donâ€™t mean that there are people who lose money, and people who win money. Being a victim is complaining about how the market is out to get you, how you are not able to battle the richer, badder, bigger guys. In fact, the market is one of the most meritocratic places, so even if you lose, you should act like a victor, not a victim. This idea is from a great [blog post](https://forum.betangel.com/viewtopic.php?t=8286). 

It pays better to be useful instead of sophisticated as these [articles](https://robotjames.com) go on, and on about. Even though I worked in quant trading for 3 years, it finally clicked for me when starting to trade the sports markets. Being useful is a good mental model to have in trading and in general. Nobody cares how sophisticated something is, unless it delivers value. This is a relatively new outlook I have taken and probably why I am focusing more on building things recently.

I have mostly talked about behavioural things - I think these are more subtle, difficult to put into words with non-obvious benefits.
