I often feel like I am fooling myself with my intuitions when trying to explain some idea to myself. In a way, I feel dishonest, as if I am not trying to get to the best explanation. Then, if I try to write my ideas down, I am often faced with the hard truth that I am not as eloquent as I sound in my head and my ideas are not as clear or complete. A lot goes on in the head of a person, and without writing, it is difficult to notice loopholes or irregularities, and therefore get a holistic view of your thoughts. 

Writing forces you into clarity. You can spend as long as you want refining your thinking, and you can iterate over your thinking as many times as necessary. I find it difficult to do serious critiquing of your own ideas and writing them down is probably a good step towards that goal. 

I was also considering whether writing should be public or private. Publicity holds you accountable, because you really have to think through whether what you have written would make sense to someone else - it allows you to be one step more exacting. Private writing instead, can be a detailed time machine for scattered ideas, akin to a diary.
