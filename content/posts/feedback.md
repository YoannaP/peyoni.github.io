I have been of the opinion for some time (maybe too much) that having lots of feedback is the optimal way to grow. I have always asked for more and for it to be negative. I had an interview recently where I was left to solve a problem for a long time without any feedback or reaction, whilst rationalising about it. I learnt that not receiving feedback during a long thought process with another person is very uncomfortable - I don't do this often. 

I think frequent feedback partly makes you feel safe - it can be encouraging to know that you are going in the right direction, or encouraging to know that you will be stopped if you go in the wrong direction, it is like a safety net. 

However, working through a problem without receiving feedback can teach you perseverance, as you have to keep going even if you have huge uncertainties about what you are saying. You have to critically think whether something you are rationalising makes sense and go back to fundamental thinking, instead of expecting validation from the other side.
