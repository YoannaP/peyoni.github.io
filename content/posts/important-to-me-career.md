As long as I have ‘what to do next’ figured out, or I do not care at the moment, another area of importance is the team and the company. 

If I have to decide whether I want to join a company - what is important to me? 

- Is the new place collaborative? Do people proactively reach out - I like to bounce ideas off of other people, so more collaboration is better than none. None is impersonal - GSA is not collaborative.  I get along better with people who receive feedback requests well and genuinely try to give it, i.e. they are critical, open to having a conversation - even if it’s a tough one.
- Is the new place fast paced? I am very impatient by nature and not getting things done or slowness gets on my nerves. High sense of urgency to get things done. I do believe more hours equal to higher output, but you also have to do this wisely (i.e. you cannot burn out). That said, I do want the new environment to be intense since I am in an age where I can afford to do this. Drive and productivity should be high.
- How do people treat low performers? I have noticed that excessive tolerance and ignorance of low performers is not the most productive way for getting things done, even with the benefit of being seen as a nice person. Drive and productivity should be high.
- Accountability and ownership.  These go hand in hand.
