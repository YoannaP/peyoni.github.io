I have been searching to get this book for some time now without much success - it’s a collection of Charlie Munger’s speeches.  Recently, Stripe Press did a reprint of this long awaited book. I finished it this week. 

Dare I say, that in general I had higher expectations. Some speeches seemed confused with random thoughts just being spat out on the page without much elaboration. Occasionally, it came out slightly too arrogant. Nonetheless, there are some very nice ideas scattered throughout that I found particularly valuable and I hope they stay with me going forward. 

Acquire a multi-disciplinary approach to problem solving. You should aim to master what other people have already figured out in different fields, not try to dream it up yourself. This can come from reading biographies, seminal works in different fields and discussing ideas which people you trust. I might be biased towards this point because I tend to be more horizontally curious, so I like reading many different books (which can sometimes be a bad thing as you can read many things superficially) so naturally this point resonated with me more. 

Approach problems in reverse. For example, when thinking what you can do that will make you happy, try asking yourself what would make you particularly unhappy… I see this being similar as choosing the path of least regrets. Dealing with such clear counterfactuals can aid faster decision making. 

Go to bed a little wiser every day. Life is maximised if you have a high aptitude and determination to be a continuous learning machine.

Unreliability, sloth and indecision are things which will fail you. Stay away from them. 

We have a duty to not become immersed in self pity. Instead it would be better to try to utilise a devastating blow in a constructive way.
