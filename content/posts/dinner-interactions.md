This is a random but subtle thought. A restaurant feature which is crucial to dinner interactions but does not get enough credit is table characteristics. 

**Shape and Position**

Firstly, if the other person is positioned opposite you, it makes for a more involved conversation because of the natural eye direction. You can sit side-by-side on the same edge, which is cozy but does not encourage a meaningful conversation. It’s difficult to follow the eye sight of the other person, especially whilst eating. 

Then there are circular tables… bad idea. There is not enough space for food if the table is small and when they are big, they are always too big to talk normally to the other person. If you are side-by-side on a circular table it feels further away than if the table was a square. As you try to come closer, you end up bumping legs.

**Large Parties**

Lets extend this to house gatherings. A small table with too many people is not great. The intimacy disappears because everyone can lean into conversations. You cannot have a one-on-one conversation with a person next to you on a small table, when the other five people are chatting about something you don’t care about. 

If you have too many people to fit on the table, sometimes you can get awkward sit-down gatherings, which resemble AA meetings. This is also not so fun because you struggle to talk to people across the gathered circle. I see this in small houses with above average amount of people - too many people to sit on the table to have dinner, but too few to mingle around. 

The fix is to have a larger house, or have more people. But really what I will try to avoid is an average amount of people in a small house.
