I tend to go through books quickly and then forget what I have read rather promptly. I have some free time now, so I am starting to put thoughts together about books which I am currently reading.

It does take some time to do this but I am too curious to find out what the effort vs benefit trade-off will look like. My guess would be that knowledge retention would be somewhat higher but I am not sure whether I will continue doing this once there are more things on my plate. We shall seeâ€¦ 

It might also be useful to anyone who is contemplating whether they should read a particular book.
