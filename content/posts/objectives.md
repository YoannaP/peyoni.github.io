Over Christmas I finished *Measure What Matters by John Doerr.* I have never been very systematic about setting objectives and measuring how I have done. I have always tried to set them, but this has never been something I stick to. 

I can see how some would argue that the most successful people have not sat down and written their objectives on paper. I don’t imagine Elon Musk sitting down on New Year’s eve and saying I will get people to Mars by the end of the year and the way I will do this is, I will send 300 rockets to space with 2 people in each one. On the other hand he does set very public objectives. He publicly says that by the end of the decade we will have people in autonomous vehicles. Often these objectives are missed, but does that actually matter as long as they make you more accountable and help you see where you are going? 

I like the OKR framework because it’s very simple and so it encourages you to be concise in what you are trying to achieve. Also, it forces you to be quantitative, and backed by evidence. It allows for tracking, so accountability scales through time. Usually when I set objectives there is rarely a structure and I tend to get lost.

On the other hand, some things are difficult to measure. Say I want to improve my communication - something which is hard to measure. Being better at communicating will come inherently by setting the right key results, for example writing more, giving more talks, recording myself after discussion, trying to explain key concepts more frequently to other people are some examples. 

**How it’s going?** 

I have been tracking objectives for 3 weeks now. Key takeaways: 

- I review them every week with measurable metrics, both on personal, work and sports trading front. This helps track what you have done well last week, and how you can do better in the following week. It’s a great reset that channels the *Go again, but harder* mentality.
- Some of the personal objectives are wrong. I think I want to improve in a certain area but as time progresses, it becomes much more apparent that I need to be improving in another area. I think this is something which will improve on a quarterly basis, one becomes better at setting the right objectives as this process is repeated.
