I came back recently from cycling the NC500, 500 miles around the coast of North Scotland. There are a couple of main points which I might, or might not, expand in the future, but wanted to summarise whilst fresh in my mind.  

**Take the offensive move**

This is related to playing offensive vs defensive in your life - something I heard on Tim Ferris when he interviewed Chris Sacca (link). 

The truth is, that I had been working quite intensely and I didn’t feel like doing a 500 mile ride as a holiday, I wanted to chill on the beach. I knew it would be super hard, which it was. But in the end, if you struggle a little bit, you make yourself a little more resilient and end up in a better spot than before. 

Looking back to my life, it has always been the case that, taking the more difficult course, making the decision which makes you more uncomfortable is always the thing which pays off in the future. 

**Type II Happiness** 

As I was cycling and the wind was 40 mph, I kept on asking myself why am I doing this to myself, why am I doing this to myself… And I didn’t really have an answer. 

But then you realise that at the end of the day, you will be in a warm bed. So it makes you grateful in a way. I definitely do not recommend going on a bike ride, without knowing how to change a tyre, or at least having a vague idea of how much elevation you will be doing. 

But I do recommend doing things which keep you away from mediocrity, make you more interesting and add a little adventure into your life - this sort of recipe probably optimises for least regrets.

**Nature Is Brutal** 

I don’t often reminisce about nature being brutal and on the verge of killing you if it wants to do that. I spend a lot of time in the mountains: mountaineering, ski touring, hiking, showshoeing. 

I have been on a mountain where people have died in the vicinity the previous day due to weather. However, I usually summit in good weather. Here, I didn’t really have a choice than to keep cycling the loop and tally the kms. There was 40mph wind in the opposite direction of the route, hail and lots of rain. Also, 10km of elevation, which was totally unexpected and adds to the difficulty of facing the wind. 

People nowadays undervalue progress in the context of the protection it gives us from nature and make bold statements about going back to live in more natural ways, but in reality probably can’t survive more than 24 hours in the open.
